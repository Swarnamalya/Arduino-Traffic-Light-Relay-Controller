# Arduino-Traffic-Light-Relay-Controller
Traffic Light Controller for Arduino

The purpose of this project is to allow the control of traffic lights using an
Arduino and micro-controllable relays.  There will be 3 versions of the project.

o 3 Way Traffic Light
o 4 Way Traffic Light
o Pedistrian Crossing Sign with countdown

My first version of the project uses a 4 way relay module with SRD-05VDC-SL-C relays.
These are mechanical relays and thus have limited lifespan.  The production versions
of the lights that I plan to release will use solid state relays with a much
longer lifespan.  There should not be any code change needed if you are to switch them
out but the wiring could change if you don't also use a 4 way module.
